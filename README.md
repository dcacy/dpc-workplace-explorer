# dpc-workspace-explorer

This tool will let you peek behind the scenes of Watson Work to see the annotations which the system adds to messages posted to a Work Space. You can look at the sentiment, keywords, concepts, relationships, custom annotations, and more. See a demo here: [https://dpc-workspace-explorer.mybluemix.net](https://dpc-workspace-explorer.mybluemix.net).
